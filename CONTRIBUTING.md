### Branching Strategy

We use a branching strategy that is adapted to our workflow. Here's a quick overview:

- `main` branch is the stable release branch.
- `develop` branch is where we merge feature branches for testing.
- Feature branches are created for each new feature or bug fix. Name your branch something like `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bug-name>`.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Style Guide

Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
